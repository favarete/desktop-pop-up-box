# desktop-pop-up-box
Simple Electron project to show Desktop pop-up for [AmazingMarvin](https://amazingmarvin.com/) notifications, using Marvin's API.
The pop-up is locked at the screen for 10 seconds before it can be dismissed.

If this is useful for you and you need a little more instructions let me know and I can try to give more atention to this description.

### TODO
- [x] Get rid of the `.ahk` scripts and connect to Marvin's API directly
- [x] Mark task as done when clicking the pop-up action button
- [ ] Auto refresh after midnight 
- [ ] Option to refresh the next alert in case something changes for the same day
- [ ] Option to toggle the blocking aspect of the pop-up
- [ ] Option to change the blocking time
- [ ] Show the time with minutes as well, instead of only the equivalent in seconds
- [ ] Option to add sound to the notification
- [ ] Option to choose the sound of the notification
- [ ] Option to post info to any other endpoint (for automation with Zapier, for example)
- [ ] Option to dismiss the notification for 5 minutes
- [ ] Option to choose for how many minutes de dismiss of the notification will be
- [ ] Some minimal GUI customizations
- [ ] Multilingual support
