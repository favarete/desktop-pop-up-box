# desktop-pop-up-box
Simple Electron project to show Desktop pop up for [AmazingMarvin](https://amazingmarvin.com/) notifications, instead of the OS toasts. I catch the notifications with the [.ahk script](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/). 

If this is useful for you and you need a little more instructions let me know and I can try to give more atention to this description.
